# Callbacks

## HandShake Callback

wolfSSL (formerly CyaSSL) has an extension that allows a HandShake Callback to be set for connect or accept. This can be useful in embedded systems for debugging support when another debugger isnâ€™t available and sniffing is impractical. To use wolfSSL HandShake Callbacks, use the extended functions, [`wolfSSL_connect_ex()`](ssl_8h.md#function_wolfssl_connect_ex) and [`wolfSSL_accept_ex()`](ssl_8h.md#function-wolfssl_accept_ex):

```c
int wolfSSL_connect_ex(WOLFSSL*, HandShakeCallBack, TimeoutCallBack,
                       Timeval)
int wolfSSL_accept_ex(WOLFSSL*, HandShakeCallBack, TimeoutCallBack,
                      Timeval)
```

`HandShakeCallBack` is defined as:

```c
typedef int (*HandShakeCallBack)(HandShakeInfo*);
```

`HandShakeInfo` is defined in `wolfssl/callbacks.h` (which should be added to a non-standard build):

```c
typedef struct handShakeInfo_st {
    char   cipherName[MAX_CIPHERNAME_SZ + 1];  /*negotiated name */
    char   packetNames[MAX_PACKETS_HANDSHAKE][MAX_PACKETNAME_SZ+1];
                                          /* SSL packet names */
    int    numberPackets;                 /*actual # of packets  */
    int    negotiationError;              /*cipher/parameter err */
} HandShakeInfo;
```

No dynamic memory is used since the maximum number of SSL packets in a handshake exchange is known. Packet names can be accessed through `packetNames[idx]` up to `numberPackets`. The callback will be called whether or not a handshake error occurred.  Example usage is also in the client example.

## Timeout Callback

The same extensions used with wolfSSL Handshake Callbacks can be used for wolfSSL Timeout Callbacks as well. These extensions can be called with either, both, or neither callbacks (Handshake and/or Timeout). `TimeoutCallback` is defined as:

```c
typedef int (*TimeoutCallBack)(TimeoutInfo*);
```

Where `TimeoutInfo` looks like:

```c
typedef struct timeoutInfo_st {
    char       timeoutName[MAX_TIMEOUT_NAME_SZ +1]; /*timeout Name*/
    int        flags;                            /* for future use*/
    int        numberPackets;               /*actual # of packets */
    PacketInfo packets[MAX_PACKETS_HANDSHAKE];  /*list of packets */
    Timeval    timeoutValue;               /*timer that caused it */
} TimeoutInfo;
```

Again, no dynamic memory is used for this structure since a maximum number of SSL packets is known for a handshake. `Timeval` is just a typedef for struct timeval.

`PacketInfo` is defined like this:

```c
typedef struct packetInfo_st {
    char           packetName[MAX_PACKETNAME_SZ + 1]; /* SSL name */
    Timeval        timestamp;                  /* when it occurred */
    unsigned char  value[MAX_VALUE_SZ];     /* if fits, it's here */
    unsigned char* bufferValue;         /* otherwise here (non 0) */
    int            valueSz;              /* sz of value or buffer */
} PacketInfo;
```

Here, dynamic memory may be used. If the SSL packet can fit in `value` then that's where it's placed. `valueSz` holds the length and `bufferValue` is 0. If the packet is too big for `value`, only **Certificate** packets should cause this, then the packet is placed in `bufferValue`. `valueSz` still holds the size.

If memory is allocated for a **Certificate** packet then it is reclaimed after the callback returns. The timeout is implemented using signals, specifically `SIGALRM`, and is thread safe. If a previous  alarm is set of type `ITIMER_REAL` then it is reset, along with the correct handler, afterwards. The old timer will be time adjusted for any time wolfSSL spends processing. If an existing timer is shorter than the passed timer, the existing timer value is used. It is still reset afterwards. An existing timer that expires will be reset if has an interval associated with it. The callback will only be issued if a timeout occurs.

See the [client example](chapter03.md#client-example) for usage.

## User Atomic Record Layer Processing

wolfSSL provides Atomic Record Processing callbacks for users who wish to have more control over MAC/encrypt and decrypt/verify functionality during the SSL/TLS connection.

The user will need to define 2 functions:

1. MAC/encrypt callback function
2. Decrypt/verify callback function

These two functions are prototyped by `CallbackMacEncrypt` and `CallbackDecryptVerify` in `ssl.h`:

```c
typedef int (*CallbackMacEncrypt)(WOLFSSL* ssl,
    unsigned char* macOut,const unsigned char* macIn,
    unsigned int macInSz,int macContent, int macVerify,
    unsigned char* encOut, const unsigned char* encIn,
    unsigned int encSz,void* ctx);

typedef int (*CallbackDecryptVerify)(WOLFSSL* ssl,
    unsigned char* decOut, const unsigned char* decIn,
    unsigned int decSz, int content, int verify,
    unsigned int* padSz, void* ctx);
```

The user needs to write and register these functions per wolfSSL context (`WOLFSSL_CTX`) with [`wolfSSL_CTX_SetMacEncryptCb()`](ssl_8h.md#function-wolfssl_ctx_setmacencryptcb) and [`wolfSSL_CTX_SetDecryptVerifyCb()`](ssl_8h.md#function-wolfssl_ctx_setdecryptverifycb().

The user can set a context per WOLFSSL object (session) with [`wolfSSL_SetMacEncryptCtx()`](ssl_8h.md#function-wolfssl_setmacencryptctx) and [`wolfSSL_SetDecryptVerifyCtx()`](ssl_8h.md#function-wolfssl_setdecryptverifyctx).  This context may be a pointer to any user-specified context, which will then in turn be passed back to the MAC/encrypt and decrypt/verify callbacks through the `void* ctx` parameter.

1. Example callbacks can be found in `wolfssl/test.h`, under `myMacEncryptCb()` and `myDecryptVerifyCb()`.  Usage can be seen in the wolfSSL example client (`examples/client/client.c`), when using the `-U` command line option.

To use Atomic Record Layer callbacks, wolfSSL needs to be compiled using the `--enable-atomicuser` configure option, or by defining the `ATOMIC_USER` preprocessor flag.

## Public Key Callbacks

wolfSSL provides Public Key (PK) callbacks for users who wish to have more control over DH, ECC, Ed25519, X25519, Ed448, X448, and RSA operations during the SSL/TLS connection.

To use Public Key callbacks, wolfSSL needs to be compiled with `HAVE_PK_CALLBACKS` defined. This can be done using the configure option:

```sh
./configure --enable-pkcallbacks
```

Additionally, each callback type requires its specific feature to be enabled (e.g., `HAVE_DH`, `HAVE_ED25519`, etc.).

### DH Callbacks

wolfSSL provides DH (Diffie-Hellman) callbacks for users who wish to have more control over DH key generation and key agreement operations during the SSL/TLS connection.

The user can optionally define 2 functions:

1. DH key generation callback
2. DH key agreement callback

These functions are prototyped by `CallbackDhGenerateKeyPair` and `CallbackDhAgree` in `ssl.h`:

```c
typedef int (*CallbackDhGenerateKeyPair)(DhKey* key, WC_RNG* rng,
                                         byte* priv, word32* privSz,
                                         byte* pub, word32* pubSz);

typedef int (*CallbackDhAgree)(WOLFSSL* ssl, struct DhKey* key,
        const unsigned char* priv, unsigned int privSz,
        const unsigned char* otherPubKeyDer, unsigned int otherPubKeySz,
        unsigned char* out, word32* outlen,
        void* ctx);
```

The user needs to write and register these functions per wolfSSL context (`WOLFSSL_CTX`) with:

* `wolfSSL_CTX_SetDhGenerateKeyPair()`
* `wolfSSL_CTX_SetDhAgreeCb()`

The user can set a context per WOLFSSL object (session) with `wolfSSL_SetDhAgreeCtx()`.

Example callbacks can be found in `wolfssl/test.h`, under `myDhCallback()`. Usage can be seen in the wolfSSL example client.

To use DH callbacks, wolfSSL needs to be compiled with `HAVE_DH` defined.

typedef int (*CallbackEd25519Sign)(WOLFSSL* ssl,
       const unsigned char* in, unsigned int inSz,
       unsigned char* out, unsigned int* outSz,
       const unsigned char* keyDer, unsigned int keySz,
       void* ctx);

typedef int (*CallbackEd25519Verify)(WOLFSSL* ssl,
       const unsigned char* sig, unsigned int sigSz,
       const unsigned char* msg, unsigned int msgSz,
       const unsigned char* keyDer, unsigned int keySz,
       int* result, void* ctx);
```

The user needs to write and register these functions per wolfSSL context (`WOLFSSL_CTX`) with:

* `wolfSSL_CTX_SetEd25519SignCb()`
* `wolfSSL_CTX_SetEd25519VerifyCb()`

The user can set a context per WOLFSSL object (session) with:

* `wolfSSL_SetEd25519SignCtx()`
* `wolfSSL_SetEd25519VerifyCtx()`

Example callbacks can be found in `wolfssl/test.h`, under `myEd25519Sign()` and `myEd25519Verify()`. Usage can be seen in the wolfSSL example client.

    unsigned int keySz, void* ctx);

typedef int (*CallbackX25519SharedSecret)(WOLFSSL* ssl,
        struct curve25519_key* otherKey,
        unsigned char* pubKeyDer, unsigned int* pubKeySz,
        unsigned char* out, unsigned int* outlen,
        int side, void* ctx);
```

The user needs to write and register these functions per wolfSSL context (`WOLFSSL_CTX`) with:

These contexts may be pointers to any user-specified context, which will then in turn be passed back to the respective public key callback through the `void* ctx` parameter.

Example callbacks can be found in `wolfssl/test.h`, under `myEccSign()`, `myEccVerify()`, `myEccSharedSecret()`, `myRsaSign()`, `myRsaVerify()`, `myRsaEnc()`, and `myRsaDec()`.  Usage can be seen in the wolfSSL example client (`examples/client/client.c`), when using the `-P` command line option.

To use Atomic Record Layer callbacks, wolfSSL needs to be compiled using the [`--enable-pkcallbacks`](chapter02.md#--enable-pkcallbacks) configure option, or by defining the `HAVE_PK_CALLBACKS` preprocessor flag.


## Crypto Callbacks (cryptocb)

The Crypto callback framework in wolfSSL/wolfCrypt enables users to override the default implementation of select cryptographic algorithms and provide their own custom implementations at runtime. The most common use case for crypto callbacks is to offload an algorithm to custom hardware acceleration,  however it could also be used to add additional logging/introspection, retrieve keys from secure storage, to call crypto from another library for standards compliance reasons, or even to perform a remote procedure call.

### Using Crypto callbacks

The high level steps use crypto callbacks are:

1. Compile wolfSSL with crypto callback support
2. Register a callback and unique device ID (`devId`) with wolfCrypt
3. Pass the `devId` as an argument to a wolfCrypt API function
4. (TLS only): associate the `devId` with a wolfSSL context


#### 1. Compile wolfSSL with crypto callback support
Support for crypto callbacks is enabled in wolfSSL via the `â€“-enable-cryptocb` configure option, or `#define WOLF_CRYPTO_CB`.

#### 2. Register your callback and unique devID with wolfCrypt

To use crypto callbacks, the user must register a top-level cryptographic callback function with wolfCrypt and provide a device ID (`devId`), which is an integer ID that uniquely identifies this particular callback function to wolfCrypt. This allows multiple crypto callbacks to be registered with wolfCrypt at once. The appropriate callback function will then be invoked internally by every wolfCrypt function that takes a `devId` parameter, or by wolfSSL when associated with a `WOLFSSL_CTX` or `WOLFSSL` structure.

To register a cryptographic callback function with wolfCrypt, use the `wc_CryptoCb_RegisterDevice` API. This takes a (`devId`), the callback function, and an optional user context that will be passed through to the callback when it is invoked.

```c
typedef int (*CryptoDevCallbackFunc)(int devId, wc_CryptoInfo* info, void* ctx);

WOLFSSL_API int wc_CryptoCb_RegisterDevice(int devId,
                                           CryptoDevCallbackFunc cb,
                                           void* ctx);
```

Note: A registered `devId` can be any value other than `-2`, which is reserved for the special `INVALID_DEVID` enum value. Passing `devId == INVALID_DEVID` as an argument into a wolfCrypt API indicates that no callback should be invoked and to use the default internal implementation instead.

#### 3. Pass the `devId` as an argument to a wolfCrypt API function

For wolfCrypt APIâ€™s, use the init functions that accept `devId` such as:

```
wc_InitRsaKey_ex
wc_ecc_init_ex
wc_AesInit
wc_InitSha256_ex
wc_InitSha_ex
wc_HmacInit
wc_InitCmac_ex
```

This will cause wolfCrypt to invoke the crypto callback in place of the default implementation. This is not an exhaustive API list. Please refer to the wolfCrypt API documentation to see if a particular algorithm supports crypto callbacks.

#### 4. (TLS only): associate the devId with a wolfSSL context

To enable use of a crypto callback when using TLS, you must supply the `devId` arguments on initialization of a `WOLFSSL_CTX` or `WOLFSSL` struct.
```c
wolfSSL_CTX_SetDevId(ctx, devId);
wolfSSL_SetDevId(ssl, devId);
```
All relevant crypto for TLS connections associated with those structures will now invoke the crypto callback.

### Writing your crypto callback

When a crypto callback is invoked, it will need to know what cryptographic operation has been requested, as well as the location of the input and output data and how to communicate success/failure back to wolfCrypt. This information is relayed to the callback through the `wc_CryptoInfo* info` argument.

At a high level, a crypto callback should determine if it supports the requested operation, act on the input data, update the `wc_CryptoInfo *info` argument with any relevant output data, and return a valid wolfCrypt error code.

#### Determining the Type of Request

The `wc_CryptoInfo` structure contains a union of different structures (some of which are unions themselves), each corresponding to a specific type of cryptographic operation. The type of operation to be performed is determined by `info->algo_type`, which should be a variant of `enum wc_AlgoType` defined in `wolfssl/wolfcrypt/types.h`.  Based on this `algo_type`, the appropriate union element within `wc_CryptoInfo` can be accessed to get or set parameters specific to the operation. We can refer to this top-level union as the "algo type union".

To determine the type of cryptographic request and process it accordingly, one would typically use a switch-case statement on the `algo_type` field of the `wc_CryptoInfo` structure. Each case within the switch would correspond to a different cryptographic operation, such as a symmetric cipher, hashing, public key operations, etc. There is a one-to-one mapping between `wc_AlgoType` and the corresponding algo type union, which are commented in the `wc_CryptoInfo` struct definition in
`wolfssl/wolfcrypt/cryptocb.h`.

The crypto callback should return zero on success, or a valid wolfCrypt error code on failure. For unsupported algorithms, the callback should return `CRYPTOCB_UNAVAILABLE`, which will cause wolfCrypt to fall back to the internal implementation.

Here's a simplified example to illustrate this:

```c
int myCryptoCallback(int devId, wc_CryptoInfo* info, void* ctx)
{
    int ret = CRYPTOCB_UNAVAILABLE;

    switch (info->algo_type) {
        case WC_ALGO_TYPE_HASH:
            /* Handle hashing, using algo type union: info->hash */
            ret = 0; /* or wolfCrypt error code */
            break;

        case WC_ALGO_TYPE_PK:
            /* Handle public key operations, using algo type union: info->pk */
            ret = 0; /* or wolfCrypt error code */
            break;

        case WC_ALGO_TYPE_CIPHER:
            /* Handle cipher operations, using algo type union: info->cipher */
            ret = 0; /* or wolfCrypt error code */
            break;

        /* and so on for other algo types... */
    }

    return ret; // Return success or an appropriate error code
}
```

Some of the simpler algo type unions, such as the RNG and seed unions, require no further processing and can be immediately acted on. However, more complicated operations like cipher or public key types have multiple union variants unto themselves that must be conditionally interpreted in the same manner. The variants and levels of hierarchy of each union are specific to each category of algorithm type, the full definitions of which can be found in the definition of the `wc_CryptoInfo` structure. As a general rule, each level that is a union will contain some sort of type indicator informing how the rest of the union should be dereferenced.

Here is a simplified example for a complex algo type union with multiple levels of union decoding. The callback contains support for random number generation, as well as ECC key agreement, sign, and verify.

```c
int myCryptoCallback(int devId, wc_CryptoInfo* info, void* ctx)
{
    int ret = CRYPTOCB_UNAVAILABLE;

    switch (info->algo_type) {
        case WC_ALGO_TYPE_PK:
            /* Handle public key operations, using algo type union: info->pk */
            switch (info->pk.type) { /* pk type is of type wc_PkType */
                case WC_PK_TYPE_ECDH:
                    /* use info->pk.ecdh */
                    ret = 0; /* or wolfCrypt error code */
                    break;

                case WC_PK_TYPE_ECDSA_SIGN:
                    /* use info->pk.eccsign */
                    ret = 0; /* or wolfCrypt error code */
                    break;

                case WC_PK_TYPE_ECDSA_VERIFY:
                    /* use info->pk.eccverify */
                    ret = 0; /* or wolfCrypt error code */
                    break;
            }
            break;

        case WC_ALGO_TYPE_RNG:
            /* use info->rng */
            ret = 0; /* or wolfCrypt error code */
            break;
    }

    return ret;
}
```

### Handling the request

The data structure for each type of request generally contains a pointer and associated size for input and output data. Depending on the request it may include additional data including cryptographic keys, nonces, or further configuration. The crypto callback should operate on the input data and write relevant output data back to the appropriate variant of the algo type union. Writing data to a union variant that does not correspond to the algorithm type in question (e.g. using `info->cipher`
when `info->algo_type == WC_ALGO_TYPE_RNG` is a memory error and can result in undefined behavior.

### Troubleshooting

Some older compilers don't allow "anonymous inline aggregates", which wolfCrypt uses when defining the nested `wcCryptoInfo` anonymous unions in order to save space. To disable the use of anonymous inline aggregates, define the `HAVE_ANONYMOUS_INLINE_AGGREGATES` preprocessor macro as `0`. This will allow crypto callbacks to be used, but will dramatically increase the size of the `wcCryptoInfo` structure.
